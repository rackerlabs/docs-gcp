Access and Permissions
======================

Controlling access and permissions to the Rackspace and GCP control planes
(APIs and UIs) along with the resources you deploy at GCP are a critical
part of the overall security of your environment.

Rackspace Account Permissions
-----------------------------

You can grant other members of your company access to Billing and Payments
and Support Ticketing by clicking the Account dropdown in the top right
corner of the
`Managed Services for Google Cloud Platform Control Panel <https://manage.rackspace.com/gcp>`_
and selecting User Management. From there, you can add and manage existing
users, selecting which parts of the Rackspace Control Panel they should have
access to.

GCP Project Permissions
-----------------------

GCP project permissions are managed via
`Google Cloud Identity and Access Management <https://cloud.google.com/iam/>`_.
If you have questions regarding the permissions you should grant users in
your company, contact a member of your :ref:`support team <support>`.

Identity/IAM
------------

Both Google and Rackspace encourage the use of the least permissive model for
IAM. In essence, access should only be granted where necessary to accomplish
tasks. Due to our Google Deployment Manager (GDM) based infrastructure-as-code
deployment model, minimizing users beyond the account used to allow
Rackspace access for management is suggested. Using GDM to deploy
infrastructure means user accounts with permission to manually create/destroy
resources in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is not supported, and instead the
GDM templates should be updated and used to deploy the infrastructure changes.

The top-down permissions model used by Google means users granted
organizational access have permissions that override more granular permissions
applied at service levels, for example. Rackspaceâ€™s policy to avoid granting
access unless necessary, and then grant it at the most granular level
possible is necessary to ensure unintentional access is not granted.

In order to ensure that your aviator projects meet this permissions model,
Rackspace may periodically audit the permissions being passed to the project
and require adjustments to to utilize the least permissive model.

Rackspace will add a service account with the Project Owner role to each of
your GCP projects that we
manage: ``automation@rackspace-mgcp.iam.gserviceaccount.com``. Additionally, we
will grant ``resource-observer@rackspace-mgcp.iam.gserviceaccount.com`` the
Viewer role on all Aviator projects. Do not remove these accounts or alter
their permissions in any way without first consulting with your
:ref:`support team <support>`. We will also temporarily add accounts from the
gcp.rackspace.com domain as Rackers and automation need access to your
projects, so do not remove those accounts or alter their permissions.


Google Organization Permissions
-------------------------------

Rackspace will also add our
``automation@rackspace-mgcp.iam.gserviceaccount.com`` service account with
the Project Creator role on your Google organization, allowing both
you and us to create additional projects for new applications, as needed.
